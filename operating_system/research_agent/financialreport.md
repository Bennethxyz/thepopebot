## Market Overview

U.S. markets staged a powerful rebound on Friday, snapping a three-day sell-off with broad-based gains across all major indices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged past the historic 50,000 milestone for the first time ever, fueled by optimism around massive AI infrastructure spending and a rotation back into risk assets.

| Index | Level | Change | % Change |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|
| S&P 500 | 6,932.30 | +134.00 | +1.97% |
| Dow Jones | 50,115.67 | +1,210.00 | +2.47% |
| Nasdaq Composite | 23,031.21 | +491.00 | +2.18% |
| Russell 2000 | ~2,330 | +81.00 | +3.60% |
| VIX | ~18.5 | -2.50 | ~-11.9% |

All three major indices posted their best single-day performance since May. The rally was broad-based, with small caps leading the charge as the Russell 2000 surged 3.6%. The VIX retreated sharply as fear subsided following the prior week's volatility spike driven by tech earnings concerns and the brief government shutdown.

### Global Markets

European markets recovered modestly, with the pan-European STOXX 600 finishing up 0.89% on Friday, though it posted a slight weekly loss. Asian markets had traded lower earlier in the session amid spillover from Thursday's U.S. tech rout. MSCI's global equities gauge rallied 1.5% for its strongest advance in months. Crude oil traded around $63.46/barrel (-1.4%). Gold pulled back slightly to ~$4,964/oz after volatile trading, remaining elevated. The U.S. dollar was mixed as investors digested the government data blackout.

## Key Market Movers

### Top Gainers
- **NVDA** (+7.8%) — Nvidia surged on renewed AI spending optimism after big tech firms announced ~$650 billion in combined AI infrastructure plans for 2026. The rally added roughly $325 billion in market cap — the fourth-largest single-day gain for any stock ever.
- **CAT** (+7.1%) — Caterpillar rallied as investors rotated into industrial and cyclical names, contributing heavily to the Dow's outperformance.
- **GS** (+4.3%) — Goldman Sachs advanced amid broad financials strength, also a key driver of the Dow's push past 50,000.

### Top Losers
- **AMZN** (-8.0%) — Amazon plunged after reporting mixed Q4 earnings and announcing a massive $200 billion capital expenditure plan for 2026 focused on AI, spooking investors concerned about near-term profitability.
- **GOOGL** (weak) — Alphabet remained under pressure following disappointing results earlier in the week.
- **ESTÉ** (weak) — Estée Lauder continued its decline amid broader consumer discretionary weakness.

### Notable Volume
Nvidia and Amazon dominated trading volume. Nvidia's 7.8% surge attracted massive buying interest, while Amazon's 8% drop triggered heavy selling. Small-cap stocks saw elevated volume as the Russell 2000's 3.6% rally drew rotational flows from mega-cap tech.

## Economic Indicators

- **February Jobs Report (Non-Farm Payrolls)** — Originally scheduled for February 6, this release has been **postponed indefinitely** due to the recent brief federal government shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has rescheduled it tentatively to February 11. This "data blackout" has significant implications for Fed policy.
- **CPI Inflation Data** — Also delayed, now expected February 13 instead of the original schedule. Markets are operating with limited visibility on the labor market and inflation trajectory.
- **Government Shutdown Impact** — The brief 2026 shutdown disrupted federal data collection and publication. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman noted the Fed is effectively "flying blind" without timely BLS data. Over 3,000 government data sets have also been removed from public access by the administration.

No major economic releases occurred on Friday due to the data disruptions.

## News Highlights

- **Dow Crosses 50,000 for the First Time** — The blue-chip index achieved a historic milestone, powered by broad gains in industrials, financials, and technology. The milestone came just days after the Dow had set an intraday record earlier in the week before the sell-off.
- **Big Tech's $650 Billion AI Spending Plan** — Major technology companies collectively announced approximately $650 billion in planned AI infrastructure spending for 2026, reigniting the AI investment thesis and lifting chipmakers sharply.
- **Amazon's $200B CapEx Shock** — Amazon's aggressive 2026 spending forecast ($200 billion, up from ~$145 billion) alarmed investors, with Bank of America resetting its price target. Key AI customers Anthropic and OpenAI remain unprofitable, raising questions about ROI.
- **Bitcoin Bounces Back Above $70,000** — After crashing to a 16-month low near $61,000 on Thursday (down ~30% for the week), Bitcoin recovered to above $70,000 on Friday as risk appetite returned. Ethereum traded around $1,900, still down ~37% year-to-date.
- **Federal Data Blackout** — The government shutdown's disruption to economic data releases has created unusual uncertainty for investors and policymakers alike, with key reports on employment and inflation delayed.

## Outlook & Analysis

**Current Conditions:** Friday's powerful rebound suggests the three-day sell-off was more of a healthy correction than the start of a sustained downturn. The Dow's breakthrough above 50,000 and the S&P 500's recovery to 6,932 indicate underlying market resilience. However, the magnitude of the bounce — best day since May — also reflects the depth of fear that preceded it. The sharp rotation from mega-cap tech into small caps, industrials, and financials suggests investors are broadening their exposure beyond the AI trade's biggest beneficiaries.

**Key Themes:** The dominant narrative remains AI infrastructure spending. The collective $650 billion commitment from big tech validates the "picks and shovels" trade (benefiting Nvidia and chipmakers) but raises legitimate concerns about returns on investment, as highlighted by Amazon's stock reaction. The tension between massive AI capital expenditure and uncertain near-term profitability will likely persist. Meanwhile, the federal data blackout introduces an unusual wild card — without timely jobs and inflation data, the Fed may be forced to hold rates steady by default, which could be interpreted as either supportive or concerning depending on how economic conditions evolve.

**Watch Items:** The rescheduled Non-Farm Payrolls report (tentatively February 11) and CPI data (February 13) will be critical catalysts. Nvidia's earnings on February 25 loom as potentially the most important single event for markets this quarter. Investors should also monitor Bitcoin's ability to hold above $70,000 after its violent selloff, the breadth of the small-cap rally for signs of sustainable rotation, and any further developments from the government data disruption. Volatility may remain elevated given the compressed schedule of delayed economic releases.
